How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
gave me the line numners where there were changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I can track changes I made to my program.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

save when u feel is important
